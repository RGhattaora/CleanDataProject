This script takes the raw data set,and performs the following:

1. Merges the Test and Train data
2. Isolates the relevant columns, namely the means and standard deviations of observations
3. Allocates descriptive variable, subject and activity labels
4. Constructs a summary table, containing an average of these observations for each subject and activity type combination

In order for the script to work, the working directory must be set to where the raw data has been extracted.
